# Advent of Code 2025

> In progress

My solutions to AoC 2025. All solutions are written in standard C11, no external libraries were used, but there is no portability guarantees as they were only tested on Linux x86-64. OS-specific headers and architecture intrinsics might be used.

> NOTE: I'm testing my setup on AoC 2021, while waiting for the 2025 challenges to be released.
